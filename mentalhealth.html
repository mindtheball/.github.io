          <p>Dealing with pressure and setbacks within the football scene can be very hard. Knowing how to deal with your pressure and stress can significantly increase your performance. This is why it is important to know how to tackle the pressure. Let’s give you some tips and tricks! &nbsp;</p>
          <p>- Notice the early signs. Pressure and stress can slowly build up with time. It is important to realize when your pressure and setbacks are starting to decrease the possibility of a burnout. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>- Express yourself. Talking about your setbacks can be fairly difficult at first but it is crucial to let these out. Talk to a friend, parents, your coach or even a professional. Taking the first step can be scary which is why we, Mind The Ball, offer you a place to talk and share your experiences with others. Visit our Feed page to anonymously communicate your story.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- Following the path of self expression, more physical self expression can be helpful when the pressure gets high. Find activities that can help you express the way you feel or find something that can help you distract yourself for a bit. Hang out with friends, hit the gym or cook yourself a meal. Having moments of rest to clear your mind is also important. But remember, distraction is never the solution in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>- Stay positive. Easier said than done but truly important. Having a positive outlook on your setbacks and pressure can help you go through them more easily. The pressure you are currently going through can be a big life learning lesson and can help future you. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>- Pause the time. Sometimes all you need is some time for yourself. Take a breather and refocus yourself. Take the time you need to figure it out. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>It is important to acknowledge that every individual has different needs when it comes to handling their personal setbacks. These tips and tricks might not be for everyone. However, take inspiration and don't knock it till you try it. </p>
