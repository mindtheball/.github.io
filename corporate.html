          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Colour scheme </strong><em></em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #397E26;"></span>
                  
              <em>#5480DE The green colour refers to the color of the grass of the football field.&nbsp;Also green is a color that makes people think of health, since it is a color we associated with sustainability and making the world better. Therefore, the color connects perfect with our target audience and goals.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #212E0F;"></span>
              #212E0F
              <em>This darker green refers to the lighter green in comibation with the grass.</em>
            </li>
			     <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #5480DE;"></span>
              #5480DE
              <em>This blue color can be associated with the blue sky while playing football as well ass the bright blue many football t-shirts have.&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>
            </ul>
            </li>
			      <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color:#EBEBEB;"></span>
                 #EBEBEB
                  <em>This light color creates a contrast between the other colors, and is also allows text to stand out more </em>
            <li><strong> Fonts</strong> <br>
                    Anton - We chose this bold and clear font, because our target audience (dutch football players) are mostly very masculine and chose for easy and clear messages. And also this font will ensure us that the reader can read our titles easily since it is a clear font. &nbsp; <br>
              Oswald - We chose this font for the subtitles, becuase this is also a clear and bold font but less bold then our heading font. The font is simple but yet it stands out. <br> Nunito - We chose nunito to make our paragraphs easy reading and easy for the eye.And again because of the simpleness and clearness of the font 
            <li><strong>User interface patterns</strong><br>
On every page, we use a navigation tab at the top and, on a smaller screen, on the right side. We chose this to make navigating through our website easy. Because our 'Tips' page includes tips for mental health and tips for exercises, we implemented a dropdown there. This way, the viewer can easily choose where they want tips for. On the exercise page, we also created a 'Learn More' button to make it easier for the viewer to immediately read more about the exercises we created, instead of going to another page to find out.</li>

                <td>Paragraph and Picture</td>
                <td>We chose to keep the homepage very clear and simple because our target audience (Dutch football players) is masculine and likes simplicity. We decided to add a picture to make the homepage easier on the eye, instead of having a page with only information, which will likely deter our target audience. 
                </td>

                <td>For the feed, again we chose to keep it simple, as explained above. We added our blue color here to create more contrast and to make you feel on a safe page. We added our comment option into boxes to make it as easy as possible on the eye.

                <td>Cards</td>
                <td>For the exercises page, we chose to use cards because we wanted to combine the explanation of the exercises with pictures. This creates an easy way to understand the exercise instead of reading a big paragraph of text. And we kept the "Learn More" button so people can quickly see which exercise they're interested in, and they can learn more about the exercise they want when they click on it.

                <td>Paragrap's&nbsp;</td>
                <td>When you come to the mental health page, you can see that we used more text instead of visuals. We decided to keep it mostly text and without pictures because the pictures will then not distract the readers from the text.
                  <a href="#"></a>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>We divided the structure of the content different on every page. We chose to make it different, because this will make it more convince to look at different pages on our website. When you click on 2 pages, and they look the same it is understandable that you get bored and leave the website. Therefore, we created every page on a different way, this will keep the readers curious. Also, every page has a different goal, by making them with a different layout the message comes across better and the reader understands that the pages possess different content. 

When we look at the design rules, we can say that we implemented them well on our website. Points we focused on were easy to navigate, visual appealing to the target audience, a clear message and using not too many words to convey the message. In appendix 1 you can see proof that our target audience agrees with this.
