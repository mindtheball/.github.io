			 <img src="images/persona.jpg" alt="Image Placeholder" width="200"> 
			<p class="newfont"><strong>Introduction:</strong> As the young, skilled soccer player he is, Max has always wanted to play soccer in the first team of the club. Even though he comes from a small town in the Netherlands, he is very eager and ambitious to improve. 

              <strong>Background: </strong> Max is a kind and ambitious 22-year-old Dutch man. He is tall, blonde and has blue eyes. He grew up in a small village in the Netherlands (near Rotterdam) and he has a fairly big friend group there and his friends from there are also in his football team. Max has played football since he was four and he has always been very competitive both in life and on the pitch. 

Max is very dedicated to his training schedule and is always looking for ways to improve but it is very hard for him to balance a good physical health combined with good mental well-being. He has always dreamed to be a successful football player and one day playing in the first division of his local team. He faces a lot of pressure as his parents, friends and coach have a lot of expectations from him. The intense training sessions also contribute to this pressure. He needs to learn how to cope with all those factors in order to achieve his dream while also staying focused. Like a lot of people at his age, Max is very active on social media. He mainly uses Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.

            <li><strong> Fonts</strong> <br>
                    Anton - We chose this bold and clear font, because our target audience (dutch football players) are mostly very masculine and chose for easy and clear messages. And also this font will ensure us that the reader can read our titles easily since it is a clear font. &nbsp; <br>
              Oswald - We chose this font for the subtitles, becuase this is also a clear and bold font but less bold then our heading font. The font is simple but yet it stands out. <br> Nunito - We chose nunito to make our paragraphs easy reading and easy for the eye.And again because of the simpleness and clearness of the font 
            <li><strong>User interface patterns</strong><br>
On every page, we use a navigation tab at the top and, on a smaller screen, on the right side. We chose this to make navigating through our website easy. Because our 'Tips' page includes tips for mental health and tips for exercises, we implemented a dropdown there. This way, the viewer can easily choose where they want tips for. On the exercise page, we also created a 'Learn More' button to make it easier for the viewer to immediately read more about the exercises we created, instead of going to another page to find out.</li>

          </table>We divided the structure of the content different on every page. We chose to make it different, because this will make it more convince to look at different pages on our website. When you click on 2 pages, and they look the same it is understandable that you get bored and leave the website. Therefore, we created every page on a different way, this will keep the readers curious. Also, every page has a different goal, by making them with a different layout the message comes across better and the reader understands that the pages possess different content. 

When we look at the design rules, we can say that we implemented them well on our website. Points we focused on were easy to navigate, visual appealing to the target audience, a clear message and using not too many words to convey the message. In appendix 1/solution interviews you can see proof that our target audience agrees with this. 

            <li>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</strong></li>
                In general, we are connecting our website to our brand by using the green colors which attract our target audience. Since green is a color that makes football players think of football. The values of our brand are respect, safety, compassion, and authenticity. We are connecting with these values on our website by using the right colors. We used, for example, a touch of blue to create a safe feeling. And we used our two colors of green to hopefully create a feeling of respect. Since every football player knows respect should always be there on the field. Also, compassion and authenticity are coming across on our website by using the correct words and visuals. For example, on our feed page we also added some quotes to create authenticity and encourage honest and quality discussions.
                <li><strong>How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?</strong><br>
                Our website fits into the marketing and communication strategy by using the exact same style and colors on all our social media as well as on our website. The main goal of our marketing and communication strategy was to engage our audience and educate them about our website that will be launched. The website goes hand in hand with our socials which creates awareness via our website to our socials and the other way around. The website also fits into our strategy because we share advice and quotes on our website as well as on our Instagram. With both platforms, we are reaching and helping our target audience.</li>
                <li><strong>How does website design help showcase the unique value proposal of the product?</strong></li>
                Our website showcases our unique value proposal of the product by showing our dedication and expertise within football and mental health. Our website offers tips and exercises to train the mind and deal with setbacks and pressure. When visiting our website, you immediately see what we do because we explain our unique value proposal on the home page. Via our navigation bar, our other offers are also easy to find.

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>In our marketing campaign we want to engage our audience and educate them about our website that will be launched. In our marketing, we mostly want to capture the attention of our target audience, so we chose not to highlight mental health as much as there would be on the website, as it is still something that is a bit of a stigma within the football community. This way, the mental health topic is approachable for them. </p>
		 <p> Our objectives (based on our Communication and Media plan) are as follows: 
			  <ul>
			  <li>
				  We will post reels weekly, as well as stories and feed posts. </li>
			  <li>
				  We want to reach 700 views and 40 likes on each reel, and get 73 followers. </li>
			  <li> According to our calculations in the Communication and Media plan, which connect to Instagram accounts made for people from our audiences, these are achievable goals to set. </li>
		      <li> 
				  Our website needs viewers to function, which makes these goals very relevant, as it widens our audience reached. </li>
			  <li>We want to achieve this within our 3 weeks of active posting. </li>
			  </ul>
			  </p>
		<p>Looking at statistics, Dutch teenagers have Instagram as their second most used social media platform. Using Instagram as our main social media platform ensures us that we can reach our target audience. Instagram also gives us a variety of different ways to reach out our target audience. We make use of posting pictures, stories and reels. </p>

          <p>We’ve learned that it is difficult to reach the audience we target. Though we reached the follower goals, the people that engaged don’t seem to fall under our targeting segments. Sadly, we do not have insights into our followers on Instagram, as we don’t have 100 followers. However, by simply scrolling through the followers it becomes evident that most of our followers are women, instead of the targeted male football players.</p>
		  <p> What worked well over the 3 weeks of promotion was generating an audience for our Instagram account. We currently have 81 followers, which is 11% more than the objective we set beforehand (see Communication and Media Plan). Our like and view goals were met only partially. From the 3 reels posted, only one got over 700 views, the other two currently have 633 and 493 views. This post is also the only post out of the six that reaches the goal of 40 likes. We assume that this has something to do with the fact that this was the first reel we posted. It is noticeable that the first two posts have the most likes and engagement, and the latest posts have the least amount of audience engagement, even though we kept a schedule regarding posting and similar hashtags. </p>
		  <p>Stories were the least successful of all of the types of posting, as this reached the least amount of non-followers. One of the story posts with a quote, posted on March 29th reached 40 accounts, of which only two were non-followers. However, looking at the latest reel post, Mind the Ball reached 371 accounts, of which 316 were non-followers, which clearly is the vast majority. Therefore, we can conclude that reels are a great tool for getting traction from a bigger audience. Next to the reel and story posts, we also made feed posts, on which the reach is much lower than the reels, but higher than the stories. For example, the latest feed post reached 92 accounts, of which almost 75% are followers. </p>
		  <p>We expected our account to have difficulty regarding like count and views, but we did not expect our numbers regarding reach and likes to decrease over the time of posting. In the future, we would try to keep the audience more engaged throughout the promotion period and post more reels.  </p>
		  <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In the past three weeks, we have posted according to our content calendar (see Planning in the Communication and Media plan), which was one feed post, one reel, and two stories per week. If this project would continue, we would still keep to a schedule, but add in another reel to be posted every week. We could post more information about the PR event, share tips and tricks videos featuring experienced soccer players and coaches, and continue posting motivational football content. .</p>
          <p>We would recommend for the campaign to include some sponsorship deals with local football clubs, and to deepen a bond with the audience by posting more interactive content. Though the stories do not get a lot of non-follower attention, we would still keep posting this, to keep more of a personal connection with the viewer.</p>
          <p>As previously mentioned, what we would do differently is mainly to higher the amount of reels in a week. However, besides that, it was hard to track down if our followers and viewers were actually interested in our brand and website. Therefore, we posted some interactive stories near the end of those 3 weeks. As this was not according to a schedule and quite last-minute, this did not receive the attention it could have gotten. For future projects like this, we would incorporate this interactive aspect of a marketing campaign sooner and more smoothly into the planning, as it can give great insights for the success of the marketing and brand.</p>
